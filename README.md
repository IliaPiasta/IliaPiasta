# About Me

I am a backend developer with 4 years of non-commercial experience. Skilled in Django, NumPy, and data science for data processing and analysis. Experienced with C and C++ programming, as well as the QT framework for GUI development. Familiar with HTML and CSS, and have working knowledge of React for building interactive user interfaces and Dart for mobile and web development.

I am proficient in web scraping and data parsing techniques, enabling efficient extraction and processing of data from diverse sources. Additionally, I have a strong interest and growing expertise in cybersecurity, including understanding common vulnerabilities, secure coding practices, and basic penetration testing methodologies. I continuously strive to enhance my skills in securing applications and protecting data integrity.

Most of my GitHub repositories contain older projects, as I prefer to keep my current work private. However, I am always open and ready to join new projects or startups where I can contribute and collaborate.

Passionate about building robust backend solutions and committed to continuous learning and improvement in software development.
