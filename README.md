## About Me

I am a backend developer with 5 years of non-commercial experience(Accept the small).  
Skilled in Django, NumPy, and data science for data processing and analysis.  
Experienced with C and C++, and the QT framework for GUI development.  
Familiar with HTML and CSS, and have working knowledge of React and Dart.

I am proficient in web scraping and data parsing, enabling efficient extraction and processing of data from diverse sources.  
Additionally, I have a strong interest and growing expertise in cybersecurity, including understanding common vulnerabilities, secure coding practices, and basic penetration testing methodologies.  
I continuously strive to improve application security and data integrity.

Most of my GitHub repositories contain older projects, as I prefer to keep my current work private.  
However, I am always open and ready to join new projects or startups where I can contribute and collaborate.
